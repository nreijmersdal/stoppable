# Stoppable upcoming feature list
- change seconds in options to minutes, but let test use seconds
- split settings and stoplist when getting it from storage

# Defects
- defaults not loaded for unlocktime

# Clean Code
- create tests for storage
- refactor stoppable, popup.js and options so they can be tested with unit-tests
- clean selenium tests to use pageObjects so the test a more readable
- error handle the sync requests
- rename url to keyword (Maybe not, how to convert existing data???)
- move storage functions that work on the stoplist to the stoplist file (how to handle errors?)
