# Stoppable upcoming feature list
- if unlocktime is left, inject screen to show after timer ends, so you cannot reload screen without a reminder

# Defects

# Clean Code
* create tests to cover centralized code
- add assertion library that checks for missing asserts for async code
- remove forEach in stoplist.js, but test it with Karma, because nodejs thinks it is fine, but it works different in Chrome
- clean all html and create the elements from code
- error handle the sync requests
- rename url to keyword (Maybe not, how to convert existing data???)
- move storage functions that work on the stoplist to the stoplist file (how to handle errors?)
