# Stoppable upcoming feature list
- after 15 minutes re-introduce the stopscreen
- change options screen to be wider and nicer
- make items on the list unique
- popup should have focus on input and enter should submit the form
- edit motivation from popup
- make window.stop() configurable to safe bandwith, disable by default

# Defects
- add maxlenght to input fields, large datasets seem to hang the sync
- osnews.com crashes chrome since the new window.stop() was introduced, maybe test with stop after rendering the modal

# Clean Code
- centralize message, use same code for popup and options.
- centralize 20 characters check code
- centralize data retrieveal, storage and defaults.
- clean all html and create the elements from code
- create tests to cover centralized code
- errorhandle the sync requests
