# Stoppable upcoming feature list
- if unlocktime is left, inject screen to show after timer ends, so you cannot reload screen without a reminder

# Defects

# Clean Code
* create tests to cover centralized code
- make unlocktime configurable between functional test run and building distribution, maybe functional test should have its own dist folder
- clean all html and create the elements from code
- error handle the sync requests
- rename url to keyword (Maybe not, how to convert existing data???)
- move storage functions that work on the stoplist to the stoplist file (how to handle errors?)
