# Stoppable
Chrome extension to empower yourself to stop wasting time on excessive website visits, but without truly blocking them.
* Download latest version in the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stoppable/opmhijblhlogdimeabllddogihbijbfj).

## Why it was created
I learned that is not a lack of self-discipline or self-control, but the wrong motivation that prevents change in behavior.

In my path to a more effective me, I tried numerous website blocking tools to prevent time-wasters like social-media, but blocking is just not the answer. Sometimes I just need to use the websites either professionally or to contact friends. Other tools added a wait time of some seconds, but that was very unhandy when I did need to use the site for real work for a while, as each page reload added the wait time again and again

None of the extensions seem to offer me a reminder why I actaully wanted to block the site and or challenge me if this was the right time to visit it. Adding and removing sites from the block lists sometimes feels like cheating and or just busy-work in itself.

## How it works
You add a keyword to the stoppable list with a reason why you do not want to visit this site anymore.
- Any website which contains the keyword in the hostname gets stopped with a screen stating the reason why it is stopped.
- Lift the stop my typing the full reason, after which you can click a button to visit the site for 15 minutes
- Use the ESC-button to fast redirect to your productivity app instead.

## Why it works
- It is all about the right motivation

## Why it doesnt work
- You can cheat it easily, you can just disabled it. If you do this, find another tool that can 100% block your visits, they exist, but in all honesty go seek professional help.
