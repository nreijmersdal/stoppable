# Stoppable
Chrome extention to empower yourself to stop wasting time on excessive website visits, without truly blocking them.

# Why it was created
I learned that is not a lack of self-discipline or self-control, but the wrong motivation that prevents change in behavior.

In my path to a more effective me, I tried numerous website blocking tools to prevent time-wasters like social-media, but blocking is just not the answer. Sometimes I just need to use the websites either professionally or to contact friends. Alternative tools are adding a wait time of some seconds, but that is also very unhandy when you do need to use the site for real work for a while, as each page reload adds the waiting time.

None of the extentions seem to offer me a reminder why I actaully wanted to block the site and or challenge me if this was the right time to visit it. Adding and removing sites from the block lists sometimes feels like cheating and or just busy-work in itself.

# How it works
You add a keyword to the stoppable list with a reason why you do not want to visit this site anymore.
- Any website which contains the keyword in the hostname gets blocked with a screen stating the reason why it is blocked.
- Lift the block my typing the full reason, after which you can click a button to visit the site.
- (TODO) Select how many minutes you want the block screen to not return for this keyword

# Why it works
- It is all about the right motivation
- Twenty second rule

# Why it doesnt work
- You can cheat it easily, you can just disabled it. If you do this, find another tool that can 100% block your visits, they exist, but in all honesty go seek professional help.
